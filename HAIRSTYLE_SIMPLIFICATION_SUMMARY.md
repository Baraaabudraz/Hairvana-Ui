## Overview
Successfully removed AI service and AR filter functionality from the Hairvana application. The hairstyle upload process is now simplified to handle image uploads only, without any processing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed AI Service Files
- ✅ Deleted `backend/services/aiService.js` - Main AI processing service
- ✅ Deleted `backend/scripts/hair_segmentation.py` - Python hair segmentation script  
- ✅ Deleted `backend/test-ai-service.js` - AI service test file
- ✅ Deleted `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### 2. Removed AR Filter Components
- ✅ Deleted `backend/routes/ar-filters.js` - AR filter download routes
- ✅ Deleted `backend/public/ar-filter-viewer.html` - AR filter viewer
- ✅ Removed AR filter route from `backend/server.js`

### 3. Removed Documentation
- ✅ Deleted `backend/AI_SERVICE_SETUP.md`
- ✅ Deleted `backend/AR_FILTER_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ Deleted `AI_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### 4. Updated Database Schema
- ✅ Removed `ar_model_url` field from hairstyles table
- ✅ Removed `segmented_image_url` field from hairstyles table
- ✅ Created migration `20250131000000-remove-ar-fields-from-hairstyle.js`
- ✅ Updated hairstyle model in `backend/models/hairstyle.js`

### 5. Updated Services and Controllers
- ✅ Removed AI processing imports from `backend/services/hairstyleService.js`
- ✅ Removed `triggerAIJobIfNeeded()`, `getAIProcessingStatus()`, `retryAIProcessing()` functions
- ✅ Simplified hairstyle response mapping to exclude AR fields
- ✅ Removed AI processing calls from hairstyle upload controller
- ✅ Removed AI status and retry endpoints from hairstyle routes

### 6. Simplified Upload Process
- ✅ Changed upload directory from `/hairstyles/original` to `/hairstyles`
- ✅ Updated upload middleware configuration
- ✅ Simplified success message (removed "AI processing initiated" text)
- ✅ Updated file deletion helper to use new path structure

### 7. Updated Frontend Demo
- ✅ Removed AR view from activeView state type
- ✅ Removed `isARActive` state
- ✅ Replaced `handleARTryOn` with `handleStyleView`
- ✅ Simplified AR preview to regular style preview
- ✅ Replaced AR toggle button with favorite/booking button

### 8. Updated Seeders and Test Data
- ✅ Removed AR-related fields from demo hairstyles seeder
- ✅ Updated customer hairstyle controller to exclude segmented image URLs

### 9. Cleaned Up Test Files
- ✅ Deleted `backend/test-hair-image.jpg`
- ✅ Deleted `backend/test-image.jpg` 
- ✅ Deleted `backend/segmented_test-image.jpg`
- ✅ Removed empty `backend/scripts/` directory

## New Hairstyle Upload Flow

1. **Upload**: User uploads image through `/api/v0/salon/hairstyle/create`
2. **Storage**: Image is stored directly in `/uploads/hairstyles/` directory
3. **Database**: Only basic hairstyle metadata + image_url is saved
4. **Response**: Immediate success response with hairstyle data

## Benefits

- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex AI processing pipeline
- **Faster Uploads**: Immediate response without background processing
- **Reduced Dependencies**: No Python/ML dependencies required
- **Lower Resource Usage**: No CPU-intensive image processing
- **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler codebase with fewer moving parts

## Database Migration

The migration `20250131000000-remove-ar-fields-from-hairstyle.js` was successfully executed to remove the AR-related columns from the hairstyles table.

## Testing

- ✅ No linter errors detected
- ✅ Database migration executed successfully
- ✅ Upload path updated correctly
- ✅ Service dependencies cleaned up

The application now has a clean, simple hairstyle upload system focused on basic image storage and management without any AI or AR processing overhead.
