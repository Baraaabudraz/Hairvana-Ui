# üßæ Billing History Creation & Invoice Email Implementation

## üìã Overview

This implementation automatically creates billing history records and sends invoice emails for all subscription payment types:
- **New Subscriptions** - When a user first subscribes to a plan
- **Upgrades** - When a user upgrades to a higher-tier plan
- **Downgrades** - When a user downgrades to a lower-tier plan

## üöÄ Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ Creates billing history records for all successful payments
- ‚úÖ Generates unique invoice numbers (format: `INV-{timestamp}-{random}`)

- ‚úÖ Links billing history to subscriptions via `subscription_id`

### 2. **Invoice Email Sending**
- ‚úÖ Automatically sends invoice emails after successful payments
- ‚úÖ Sends invoices for new subscriptions, upgrades, and downgrades
- ‚úÖ Uses existing email service infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Includes payment details, plan information, and owner details

### 3. **Billing History Backfill**
- ‚úÖ Function to create billing history for existing payments
- ‚úÖ API endpoint to trigger backfill manually
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate billing history records

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Updated Files:**

#### 1. **`backend/services/subscriptionPaymentService.js`**
- Added `BillingHistory` model import
- Enhanced `handleSuccessfulSubscriptionPayment()` function
- Enhanced `handleUpgradePayment()` function  
- Added `ensureBillingHistoryForAllPayments()` function
- Enhanced `sendInvoiceEmailForPayment()` function

#### 2. **`backend/controllers/Api/salon/subscriptionPaymentController.js`**
- Added `backfillBillingHistory` endpoint
- Returns count of created vs existing records

#### 3. **`backend/routes/Api/v0/salon/subscription.js`**
- Added route: `POST /payment/backfill-billing-history`

### **New API Endpoints:**

```javascript

POST /api/v0/salon/subscription/payment/backfill-billing-history
```

## üìä Billing History Record Structure

Each billing history record includes:

```javascript
{
  id: "UUID",
  subscription_id: "UUID", // Links to subscription
  date: "Date", // Payment date
  amount: "Decimal", // Payment amount
  status: "String", // Payment status (paid, pending, etc.)
  description: "String", // Human-readable description
  invoice_number: "String", // Unique invoice number
  subtotal: "Decimal", // Payment subtotal
  total: "Decimal", // Total amount
  tax_amount: "Decimal", // Tax amount (currently 0)
  created_at: "Date",
  updated_at: "Date"
}
```

## üîÑ Payment Flow with Billing History

### **New Subscription Flow:**
1. User creates payment intent
2. Payment is processed via Stripe
3. Webhook calls `handleSuccessfulSubscriptionPayment()`
4. Subscription is created
5. **Billing history record is created** ‚úÖ
6. **Invoice email is sent** ‚úÖ
7. User receives confirmation

### **Upgrade/Downgrade Flow:**
1. User creates upgrade/downgrade payment intent
2. Payment is processed via Stripe
3. Webhook calls `handleSuccessfulSubscriptionPayment()`
4. Detects upgrade/downgrade payment
5. Calls `handleUpgradePayment()`
6. Subscription is updated
7. **Billing history record is created** ‚úÖ
8. **Invoice email is sent** ‚úÖ
9. User receives confirmation

## üìß Invoice Email Content

Invoice emails include:
- **Payment Details**: Amount, date, payment method
- **Plan Information**: Plan name, billing cycle, features
- **Owner Information**: Name, email, salon details
- **Invoice Number**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Professional HTML Template**: Branded with Hairvana styling

## üß™ Testing

### **Test Script:**
```bash
cd backend
node test-billing-history.js
```

### **Manual Testing:**
1. **Create a new subscription** - Verify billing history and email
2. **Upgrade subscription** - Verify billing history and email
3. **Downgrade subscription** - Verify billing history and email
4. **Backfill existing payments** - Use the backfill endpoint

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### **Console Logs:**
- Billing history creation confirmations
- Invoice email sending status
- Error handling for failed operations

### **Database Queries:**
```sql
-- Check billing history records
SELECT * FROM billing_histories;

-- Check billing history with subscription details
SELECT bh.*, s.status as subscription_status, sp.name as plan_name
FROM billing_histories bh
JOIN subscriptions s ON bh.subscription_id = s.id
JOIN subscription_plans sp ON s.plan_id = sp.id;
```

## üö® Error Handling

### **Graceful Degradation:**
- If billing history creation fails, payment still succeeds
- If invoice email fails, payment still succeeds
- All errors are logged for debugging

### **Common Issues:**
- **Missing subscription**: Payment exists but no subscription found
- **Email configuration**: SMTP settings not configured
- **Database constraints**: Foreign key validation failures

## üìà Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements:**
1. **Tax Calculation**: Integrate with tax service for accurate tax amounts
2. **Multiple Currencies**: Support for different payment currencies
3. **Invoice Templates**: Customizable invoice email templates
4. **PDF Generation**: Generate downloadable PDF invoices
5. **Recurring Billing**: Automatic invoice generation for recurring payments

## üéØ Usage Examples

### **Backfill Existing Payments:**
```bash
curl -X POST "{{ServerUrl}}/api/v0/salon/subscription/payment/backfill-billing-history" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### **Send Invoice for Specific Payment:**
```bash
curl -X POST "{{ServerUrl}}/api/v0/salon/subscription/payment/{{paymentId}}/send-invoice" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## üîê Security Considerations

- All endpoints require owner authentication
- Users can only access their own payment data
- Billing history creation is transaction-safe
- No sensitive payment data exposed in logs
